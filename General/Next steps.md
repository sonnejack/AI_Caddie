- Create a plotly plot for the shot data from trackman. Start determining how to create the dispersion oval (shots must be same club, shot type, and player) and identify the worst 20% of shots to exclude and mark differently. Plot all of them on the same graph with dropdowns for each shot type and player (option to display all for each player)
- Consider using the model to generate trajectories in the future
