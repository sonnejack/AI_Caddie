**Facts:**
- Trackman Normalization settings default to 77*F, no wind, sea level, premium golf ball
- flightscope trajectory optimizer defaults to 77*F, no wind, sea level, premium golf ball
- flightscope uses spin axis, which trackman doesn't track by default


**Assumptions:**
- flightscope trajectory optimizer is accurate enough to take trackman data input. I tested a few numbers and was within 0.5%
information can be calculated in 'real time'. Need to create a physics model that yields close enough results to the flightscope
